# RBTXTE
a really bad .txt editor  
written in python    
## version 0.01 
named doukutsu, is a rewrite of my original project 
## version 0.02
named monogatari, added renaming, however it allso created an issue
## version 0.03
named heros end (cause it removed some features that would be useful) removed renaming but fixed some issues
## version 0.04
has no name, it just added RBTXTE lite  
## version 0.05
named misery. (technically its 0.04 because just adding rbtxte lite isnt really an update)  
improves graphics greatly (using questionary and rich)  
however it does not yet improve file editing (which will be in next update)
