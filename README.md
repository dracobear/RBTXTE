# RBTXTE
a really bad .txt editor  
written in python  
if you want a more general version with the ability to make files in different folders, use TFM by @m4r1naaaa  
version 0.01, named doukutsu, is a rewrite of my original project inspired by my work in TFM  
version 0.02, named monogatari, added renaming, however it allso created an issue
version 0.02, named heros end (cause it removed some features that would be useful) removed renaming but fixed some issues
